# XADGPS-Client
Android application for tracking the location and status of e-bikes and e-scooters equipped with Monorim® trackers (e.g. G16A).

This app is meant as a replacement for the original XADGPS app provided by Monorim due to it having lots of UI glitches and general bugs.
For more information on the (un?)official API visit [this page](https://appapi.xadgps.com/openapiv4.asmx).

This project is not affiliated with Monorim®.
